# Community Assets

This repository largely consists of a monthly export of the assets that have been uploaded to the user repos at www.makehumancommunity.org.

## Why is this repo on github rather than bitbucket?

This repo has been placed outside the normal MakeHuman repositories to make it clear that the contents are not official MakeHuman resources.
The assets are provided by community users. The MakeHuman team takes no responsibility as to the functionality or applicability of the assets.
Support, if needed, should be asked of the individual asset authors rather than of the MakeHuman team.
