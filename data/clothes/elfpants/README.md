Part of the Elf Warrior outfit i designed - this being for the legs.  As with the Elf Warrior jacket, i include here an Anisotropic material, the difuse material is automatically applied, but that is only for the brown fabric sections on the legs, for the rest  - in blender you need to choose the vertices that will be metal in edit mode and then set that material to Anisotropic then plug the texture provided into the color. this is the only way to get a realistic metal material -  If you do not do this then the metal will appear matte white.
