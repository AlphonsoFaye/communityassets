model i started for someone.   good first 3dmax-> blender/makeclothes project.  lacks detail, has some fitting issues and does not include bump/spec as it is just a test -aside form that let me know of any problems.
material does not show at first, need to go to materials and apply it manually.  < anyone know how to fix that?  anyone know if it is possible to apply more than one texture to a single clothes model?  if so is this done in blender or possible through .mhmat,  and can you point me toward an example?
