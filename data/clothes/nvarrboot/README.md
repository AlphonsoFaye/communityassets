Here I upload new boots. The mesh they're based on I've found in the internet, it was called N'varr boots. It was associated with some character, but in the time it took me to make them MH-ready I've forgot what character it was or even which fandom it comes from. Probably Star Wars something, but won't bet on it. Nevertheless, despite not knowing what kind of creature wears this kind of boots, they look decent so I think why to share them? Known issues: may look bat shit weird in MH, but after export everything's alright. Subdivision modifier recommended after importing. I also upload the mask in specular texture slot, it can be used as an AO texture or as basis for creating new diffuse textures more easily.
