If you use Blender, Tip 1: After import, tweak the clothing with the sculpt tool, the clay and smooth brush with low strength to get rid of eventually ugly deformation and make the final fitness. Tip 2: Use the Solidify modifier, thickness 1mm, fill Only Rim to give the fabric some thickness.

As usual, I have not made any effort in the material settings.
