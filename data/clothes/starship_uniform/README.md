So here I upload my adaptation of starship uniform by Sculletto as shown in http://www.makehumancommunity.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=13010 for MH. I think I've more or less figured out the UV texturing and bump mapping, at least in some techniques. The uniform looks reasonably decent, but if anyone else will take on themselves to improve it I won't mind and I don't think the original author would either.
