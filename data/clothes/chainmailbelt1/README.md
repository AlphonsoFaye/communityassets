This one is tricky!  If you don't get the sequence right, vertices will have more than 8 poles, and therefore won't compile in MakeClothes.  Also, just this is a very data-intensive mesh, so I'm going to create the belt buckle (clasp?) separately.  Finally, this mesh won't load properly into my present unstable version of Makehuman, but the wavefront object imports and exports into several versions of Blender without a problem.
