Tags: Female, Casual. A simple summer dress. Hard to make loose fitting clothes especially at the chest, at least with my knowledge so far, I sat several days and tested different vertexgroup assignment to try making the skirt and chestpart more flexible in deformation but I gave up and used the default automatic group assignment. The chest part and the skirt can be ugly deformed in some circumstances.
The seams at the back above the shoulder blades will be deformed when subsurfed without extra edgeloops.
If you use Blender, use the Sculpt Mode with Clay and Smooth brush at low strength to adjust deformation and fitness.
