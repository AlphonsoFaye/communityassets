# Low mini-skirt

The texture here is from actual fabric.  Note that the inside is textured as well as the outside--and that you won't be able to hide faces in MH.

The "bump" texture is an alternate diffuse texture (not from actual fabric, but still looks nice enough).

UPDATE:  I've adjusted the vertex groups on the human proxy, and the waist and hem now work for all ages and genders (except babies).

UPDATE 2:  It looks like, in the last update, I screwed things up by re-uploading some of the files but not others.  It's fixed now.

UPDATE 3:  Added edges between the front and back faces of the skirt, to prevent them from separating when a cloth modifier is used.
