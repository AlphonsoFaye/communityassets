The first in a series of Minoan and Ancient Greek hair styles.  This one is inspired by a 4,000-year-old mosaic found in Crete.  The material is tinted blue, to make it easier to work with on the screen.  I've updated the UV map, and added a new diffuse texture of one-pixel-wide lines. This wig will work on any standard Makehuman female.
