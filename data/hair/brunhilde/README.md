A sculpted hairpiece based on an old painting of Brunhilde. For you Wagnerian types. It clears the body quite well, so it should move well.  Best to use on an adult female model.  The diffuse texture map is made up of 1 pixel lines of color, so if you want to make the hair more photo-realistic, just adjust the UV map.
