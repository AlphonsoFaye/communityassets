# Anime hair test

After I saw the technique of making anime-style haircuts out of individual blades, I tried it and then thought I'm done with it. Nevertheless, I continued to experiment and tested it quite a bit, until I finally came up with something that looked almost half-decent. The problems I mentioned in the thread — too many overlap, overcomplicated mesh etc… are still there, but I thought might as well share what I have got. Who knows, maybe somebody will use it for something, or maybe it will give somebody new ideas. There's still not a lot of usable hair in MH repository, so I guess every little bit helps…
