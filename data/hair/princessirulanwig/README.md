An example of a highly-elaborate hairstyle worn by House Corinno from Frank Herbert's 'Dune'.  Here is a new diffuse texture  and a new texture map. 
It is 3304 by 3291 pixels, at 144 pixel depth. I had to create lines of 1 pixel width, and group them to get this texture. Remember to turn up the Normals setting to create the illusion of separate hairs.
